      <description>Random birthday Last week, I turned to 25. I had a small dinner with my family, that is all I need on that day. Btw, it was just a normal day likes every single day.
The reason of the feeling is every day, when I can take breath, feel the pains, hear the sounds, eat a pie, talk to people and think about random things. It is a special and wonderful day !</description>

      <description>Random nights Last wednesday night, after having dinner, going around and enjoying traffic jam in Sai Gon. I stopped in front of Le Van Tam park (the most beautiful park in there).
Walked 2 rounds the park, took a deep breath and enjoyed the border between silence in park and noise on street. It made me feel I was living, but not existing.
Stepped in center of the park, there were a lot of activities (hiphop, skating, working out, dancing, &amp;hellip;) by people from kids to teenagers and even old men.</description>

      <description>Random things  Everything is nothing
 You got everything means you had nothing.
 Nothing is something
 You had nothing means you got something (it is NOTHING)
 So something is &amp;hellip; everything
 Sometimes you got something means you had everything, and lost something means lost everything.
Something is mostly the BELIEF

      <description>Random quote  ‚ÄúInsanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.‚Äù - Albert Einstein
 It&amp;rsquo;s true in LOGIC ! But sometimes, it goes wrong in computer science and &amp;hellip; life.
What does computer program do ? We learnt from Computer Science courses this phisolophy :
 PROGRAM takes INPUT and produces OUTPUT
So, same PROGRAM + same INPUT = same OUTPUT
 And that&amp;rsquo;s the basis of every testing techniques.</description>

      <description>No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
Do Not Worry
Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</description>

      <description>In the last post &amp;ldquo;What is your Why ?&amp;rdquo;, we all know &amp;ldquo;To live is to connect&amp;rdquo;
 Connect people Connect wires Connect the Internet Connect events Connect THINGS  But, TIME will f*ck up everything from its order. It makes connected things disconnected ! It&amp;rsquo;s painful, but at least that&amp;rsquo;s called life.
We have thousand ways to disconnect from things in each context.
 In Electricity : just capping electrical wires or plug it out, &amp;hellip; In Computer Network : building a firewall then blocking packets from its source, or easier just to plug the cable out from network card, &amp;hellip; In Traveling : destroy road, bridge In Phone : blocking contact from incoming number, or change your new number, or just throw your phone out the windows In Social Networks : un-follow, un-friend, or block people from your network.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s start pull PHP images docker pull php:5.6 docker pull php:7  Change directory to the web root folder of PHP project (I used my micro-framework, Sifoni to test).</description>
