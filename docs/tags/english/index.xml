      <description>Introdution At this moment, AWS SES service is the best affordable price and high-quality service to sending (and receiving) programmatic emails. But, one day your account could be suspended without notice, and that takes a big effort of requesting support to get it back to work.
So it&amp;rsquo;s good to prevent that siatuation happens by watching your Bounces Rate and Complaints Rate. One way to resolve problem when your rates being too-high than allowance, is send a big amount of dummy emails to your blackhole email address.</description>

      <description>Just my 2 cents &amp;hellip;
Nowaday, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see a news about AI (artificial intelligence) on the media. Even we are using it everyday without cognition. SO WHAT IS IT ? IS IT GOOD or BAD ? AND CAN WE &amp;hellip; EAT IT ?
In this article I will try to answer that questions :
 AI is just technology, so you can&amp;rsquo;t eat it ;) Technology is just a &amp;hellip; technology, a thing that human created.</description>

      <description>Random quote  “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” - Albert Einstein
 It&amp;rsquo;s true in LOGIC ! But sometimes, it goes wrong in computer science and &amp;hellip; life.
What does computer program do ? We learnt from Computer Science courses this phisolophy :
 PROGRAM takes INPUT and produces OUTPUT
So, same PROGRAM + same INPUT = same OUTPUT
 And that&amp;rsquo;s the basis of every testing techniques.</description>

Do Not Worry
Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</description>

      <description>New version of PHP, PHP7 has been released yesterday after 11 years of PHP5. I am very excited with it, so I made a benchmark to compare the performance of 2 versions.
The fastest way to test out PHP multi-versions is using Docker image. You can get it from : https://hub.docker.com/_/php/
Let&amp;rsquo;s start pull PHP images docker pull php:5.6 docker pull php:7  Change directory to the web root folder of PHP project (I used my micro-framework, Sifoni to test).</description>
