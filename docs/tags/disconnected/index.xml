      <description>In the last post &amp;ldquo;What is your Why ?&amp;rdquo;, we all know &amp;ldquo;To live is to connect&amp;rdquo;
 Connect people Connect wires Connect the Internet Connect events Connect THINGS  But, TIME will f*ck up everything from its order. It makes connected things disconnected ! It&amp;rsquo;s painful, but at least that&amp;rsquo;s called life.
We have thousand ways to disconnect from things in each context.
 In Electricity : just capping electrical wires or plug it out, &amp;hellip; In Computer Network : building a firewall then blocking packets from its source, or easier just to plug the cable out from network card, &amp;hellip; In Traveling : destroy road, bridge In Phone : blocking contact from incoming number, or change your new number, or just throw your phone out the windows In Social Networks : un-follow, un-friend, or block people from your network.</description>
