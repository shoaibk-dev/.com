      <description>SYSADMIN Blocking specified country to prevent from DDOS Last day I checked system logs and got a lot of warning messages mentioned that my server has been attack via Brute-force. So I decided to blocked some countries from connecting to attacked ports (21, 25). They are China, Russia and US.
This site provides a list of IP blocks of specified country

      <description>HTTP ab failed responses When benchmarking a HTTP application server using ab tool, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t only care about how many requests per second, but percentage of Success responses.
A notice that you must have the same content-length in responses, because ab tool will assume response having different content-length from Document Length (in ab result) is failed response.
Example
Webserver using Flask
from flask import Flask from random import randint app = Flask(__name__) @app.</description>
