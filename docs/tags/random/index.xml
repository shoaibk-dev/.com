      <description>Random birthday Last week, I turned to 25. I had a small dinner with my family, that is all I need on that day. Btw, it was just a normal day likes every single day.
The reason of the feeling is every day, when I can take breath, feel the pains, hear the sounds, eat a pie, talk to people and think about random things. It is a special and wonderful day !</description>

      <description>Random nights Last wednesday night, after having dinner, going around and enjoying traffic jam in Sai Gon. I stopped in front of Le Van Tam park (the most beautiful park in there).
Walked 2 rounds the park, took a deep breath and enjoyed the border between silence in park and noise on street. It made me feel I was living, but not existing.
Stepped in center of the park, there were a lot of activities (hiphop, skating, working out, dancing, &amp;hellip;) by people from kids to teenagers and even old men.</description>

      <description>Random things  Everything is nothing
 You got everything means you had nothing.
 Nothing is something
 You had nothing means you got something (it is NOTHING)
 So something is &amp;hellip; everything
 Sometimes you got something means you had everything, and lost something means lost everything.
Something is mostly the BELIEF

      <description>Random quote  ‚ÄúInsanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.‚Äù - Albert Einstein
 It&amp;rsquo;s true in LOGIC ! But sometimes, it goes wrong in computer science and &amp;hellip; life.
What does computer program do ? We learnt from Computer Science courses this phisolophy :
 PROGRAM takes INPUT and produces OUTPUT
So, same PROGRAM + same INPUT = same OUTPUT
 And that&amp;rsquo;s the basis of every testing techniques.</description>

      <description>Random trip Last week, I had a trip to Da Nang city with my friends (and my business partners). It&amp;rsquo;s a nice trip, beautiful places, good food and yeah &amp;hellip; cool experience.
In this city, I met a 73-year-old man (wife-father of my friend) who inspired me about works and life.
I asked myself, could I live good as him at that age ? Or still stuck in my small circle ?</description>

GOD please help me !&amp;rdquo;.
