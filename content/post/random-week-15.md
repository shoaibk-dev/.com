## Random article

Last day, I read a random article on Hacker News - ["Slow the fuck down"](http://blog.officehours.io/slow-the-fuck-down/). Yah, interesting title lead me to read it because of curious. (Actually, I like to read any article contains "fuck" or "shit") 😝

The best say I really really love is

> You’re busy because you’re weak.

I will translate it to Vietnamese when I create some free time.

## Random idea

I'm bad in English for sharing (sharing requires writing and speaking). I thought "Why don't I write about how to learn English from stupid man like me ?". Yup, best way to learn is to share and to teach others.

So I will start my new series - **LFEY** (Learn Fucking English by Yourself) in Vietnamese.

I don't care about who are my readers, my audiences. At least I have one, myself 😸

## Random language

I started learning Go lang, new hot-trend programming language has been eating the world.

It made me remember C lang I learnt from university. It's good for system and safety-need software. But personally, I don't like it because it consumes a lot of efforts to release a runnable product.

So I decided return back to my lovely language, PHP. It just works !

> Stop using shiny new things and love one that works

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
```
