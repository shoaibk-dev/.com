## Random routine

Switching new living place, I have to do something by myself :

- Ironing clothes
- Washing disks
- Cleaning room

I hadn't done these jobs for long time. They consume my time, energy but make me feel more freedom, more love in my parents.

## Random talk

Having a talking diner with my boss, I learnt how to become a management guy.

1. Firstly, I have to reduce my expectation on people in what I can't change. Hoping instead of expectation !
2. Secondly, firing an employee isn't simple.
3. And last but not least, hiring becarefully and firing fastly.

## Random question

> What do I really want at work ?

> Money ? Experience ? Recognition ?

> or just Time Burning ?
