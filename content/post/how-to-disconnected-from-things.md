In the last post "[What is your Why ?](/post/what-is-your-y/)", we all know "To live is to connect"

- Connect people
- Connect wires
- Connect the Internet
- Connect events
- Connect THINGS

**But, TIME will f*ck up everything from its order. It makes connected things disconnected ! It's painful, but at least that's called life.**

We have thousand ways to disconnect from things in each context.

- In Electricity : just capping electrical wires or plug it out, ...
- In Computer Network : building a firewall then blocking packets from its source, or easier just to plug the cable out from network card, ...
- In Traveling : destroy road, bridge
- In Phone : blocking contact from incoming number, or change your new number, or just throw your phone out the windows
- In Social Networks : un-follow, un-friend, or block people from your network. Social Networks nowaday make it easier to connect and disconnect so. **EASY COME EASY GO**

**It's ez as pie !!! Right ? Just need scissors or 3 clicks ... BAMMMM ! You're disconnected ...**

Okay, but in human relationship, this pie is hard to swallow. To be honest, it's pain in ass ! You can't totally forget the one you wanted to disconnect. It's a paradox !

> You can't solve a problem by focusing on phenomenon but not essence. - Someone told me that

Last month ago, I tried to disconnect from ZALO (a messaging platform) because I lost my SIM card. And you guess what ? I have to connect to disconnect. LOL, it's seem a wrong idea but true. Sometimes you have to do a reverse way to make thing DONE.

Just a coincidence, I bought this T-Shirt and 1 more with "CONNECT" text 1 month ago. WHAT A MAGICAL RANDOM !!!

> Finally, TIME disconnects thing to make it connectable. So keep disconnected pain in your mind (you can't forget it), and try **RECONNECTING**

**Does it matter ? Nope.**
