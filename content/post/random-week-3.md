# Random game

Last 2 days, my team went to play bowling. That was the first time we playing it. We had a good time to enjoy the moment playing together. The game is fun and interesting :D If you haven't try it yet, TRY IT ASAP !!!

So what make this game interesting ?

1. It's DEAD SIMPLE, just throw the ball, that's all
2. It makes you feel like you throw your mood to destroy sorrowful, stressful and hateful. Trust me, people like destroying, somehow.
3. It's unpredictable, don't believe it ? [Check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNUR8wT1UM8)

Below is my team video :D
