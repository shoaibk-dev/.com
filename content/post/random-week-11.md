Today, in church, the priest said

> "Đời vốn đã khổ, vì thế đừng làm khổ nhau hơn nữa. Thay vào đó hãy làm nó vui hơn - hạnh phúc hơn !"

-----------------------------------

This week, there is a story make me think about :

Last 2 days, my high school friend, .... committed suicide. He wasn't my close friend and rarely talked with him but he was a good man. When I heard about him, I felt emptiness, no feeling (Is my soul cold ?).

I asked myself : Why does someone give up and leave everything ?

- Broken ?
- Get Stuck ?
- Or Stressed ?
- Nope, nope, I can't imagine that because I'm not in that situation.

**But I think it may be getting lost of belief.**

> The belief in something is the first-and-last reason why you continuously live your life.

> What is your something ?

*GOD BLESS YOU !*
