## Random book

On Sunday night, I read a random article from Medium by **James Altucher**. Its title is [What Are Things That Do Not Matter In Life?](https://medium.com/the-mission/what-are-things-that-do-not-matter-in-life-70e851688967), I will translate it to Vietnamese when I create some free-time. It's great article !

In article, the author led me to his book (his marketing strategy works on me). Then I bought a Kindle version on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-James-Altucher-ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4) with the good price, 0.99$. I will send you a gift (a kindle version of the book), just send me an email to **hi(at)khanhicetea.com** or comment below your Amazon email account. (Only available for first 5 senders, because I'm not rich yet ðŸ˜Š). I believe that you will continue to share it to other ones.

Okay, get back to what I learned from the author

> We spend our lives afraid of the emptiness. We want to fill it with love, with money, with pleasures, with anything that could put off the ultimate. But all of those things are never enough. They all decay. Only the emptiness does not decay.

Everything is EMPTY INSIDE ! (ðŸ˜‚ likes INTEL slogan)

> I give up. I canâ€™t control the past or the future. They are empty, just like I am. All there is is now. Done.

Only thing exists is NOW ! (**NOW** can stands for **No Opportunity Wasted**)

> How do you surrender? By trusting that youâ€™ve done the right preparation. Youâ€™ve done all you can do. All that is within your power, your control. Now, give up the results. The right thing will happen.

DONE ! WE'VE ALL DONE !!! Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

> In other words, donâ€™t stay at the job for safe salary increases over time. That will never get you where you wantâ€”freedom from financial worry. Only free time, imagination, creativity, and an ability to disappear will help you deliver value that nobody ever delivered before in the history of mankind.

Dammn ! This say has answered question which stuck in my head 5 years.

> If a painful memory arises, donâ€™t fight it or try to push it awayâ€”youâ€™re in quicksand. Struggle reinforces pain. Instead, go to love. Love for yourself. Feel it. If you have to fake it, fine. Itâ€™ll become real eventually. Feel the love for yourself as the memory ebbs and flows. That will take the power away.

Somebody keeps saying **"Life is a sea of suffering"**, but why don't they end their life to stop suffering ? Stop blaming about life, just live !

## Random routine

- I try using stairs instead of elevator. It makes me healthier
- I go to church after work. It makes me less empty
- I joined technical meet-up event, it's very good. Many good guys there willing to share and to be shared. I just plan to make a presentation next couple weeks.

I will make new routine every week. I believe it makes new me

## Random wallpaper

I just reinstalled Ubuntu OS for my PC. And randomly, I got this lock screen wallpaper

Haha, looks like a kiddy painting, but it presents for the emptiness, messy reality of life.

## Random answer

> If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things ?

Nope ! Just because I can't change it, it will happens whatever I do. If I can change it, the question is really fucked up ðŸ˜Ž What a bullshit question !
