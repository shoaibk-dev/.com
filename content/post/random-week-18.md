## Random nights

Last wednesday night, after having dinner, going around and enjoying traffic jam in Sai Gon. I stopped in front of Le Van Tam park (the most beautiful park in there).

Walked 2 rounds the park, took a deep breath and enjoyed the border between silence in park and noise on street. It made me feel I was living, but not existing.

Stepped in center of the park, there were a lot of activities (hiphop, skating, working out, dancing, ...) by people from kids to teenagers and even old men. They were so happy and joyful when being together.

I realized that a good life had more than working together but ... enjoying together. Every single man has only one life to live, or to exist, or even to stuck in a endless loop til die.

> So, be kind to yourself, and f*ck shit up !

After that night, I often go to the park to walk and to enjoy my living moment with the people.
