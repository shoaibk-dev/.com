> STOP THINKING, JUST ... LIVE

This week article is short because I left something behind. I just closed a door.

> WHEN A DOOR CLOSES, ANOTHER ONE OPENS - Graham Bell

Yeap, I think it's true. And, it happens today ... Should I try next door ?

Sure, whatever happens, it's [WORTH A SHOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ6aHTngQEg) !

*Some will stay,*

*Some want to leave.*

*I roam around, around*

*The street where you live.*

*I'm learning to forgive*

*But don't know how to forget*

*The worst goodbye I've had*

*this one we'll never say.*

**Btw, thank you for making me happy ! (MADE)**
