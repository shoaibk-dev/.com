## Random luck

Five days ago, while I was riding bike at 50km/h, one "cute" stone hit my head. I was shocked and didn't know what was going on. After calming down and slowing down the bike, I told to myself "Oh shit ! It's fucking bad and hurt ! How can I continue to ride ? Would I lost my mind ? GOD please help me !".

After 10-minute feeling the pain and thinking about my life. I realized this accident is my luck, a reminder from GOD, remind me that I am alive, breathing, working, feeling and loving. What could I need more from him ? Live longer ? More money ? More time to work ? More pain to feel ? Or more love to love ?

> NOPE ! This is enough, just stay in here

## Random one

She make me feel happy, funny, safety, lovely and ... really. She asked me, "Am I a shadow of someone else ?". Everyone I met, is UNIQUE ! And she isn't exception. I can't forget memories, but only focus on the present. What the hell is another shadow when everyone already had one ?

## Random experience

Last week, I tried many diferrent roles from Product Manager to Sales and Customer Supporter. I learned a lot from it, improved my soft skills and importantly my customer relationships.

From now, I will [start building my audience](http://www.ianharris.com/start/)

> “I never heard of a business that sank because it didn’t have enough computers. But I know plenty of businesses that failed because it didn’t have enough customers.”

People asked me why I still worked on this company. I just answered them :

**BECAUSE OF :**

- TRUST
- EXPERIENCE
- AND RESPECTED BOSS

## Random song

{{< youtube FM7MFYoylVs >}}

```
She said "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss"

"I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo"
```
