**Ask, Seek, Knock**

*‚ÄúAsk and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.*

*‚ÄúWhich of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.*

[Mt 7,7-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:7-12)

> So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you

What if you asked, you sought, you knocked and you gave but nothing's received ?

> Just walk away ! Then giving 10$ to receive 10 beers is better deal üçª

Because the root of problem isn't you, it's just wrong time, wrong place and right-but-not-fit person.
