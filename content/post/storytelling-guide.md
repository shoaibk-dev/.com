## CAS = Context -> Action -> Result

### Context

- Where and When ?
- 3 questions
    - Who is the hero ? 
        - real or fictitios
        - person, place or thing (should related to your audience)
        - or yourself
    - What do they want ?
        - worthy objective
    - Who or what is getting in the way ? (bad guy)
        - (real or fictitios)
        - person, place or thing (should related to your audience)
        - must be an obstacle
        - not "larger than life" (can do anything kind)

### Action:

- must have context
- hero does battle with the villain
- at least on up-and-down
- comes to a resolution

### Result :

- Tell how the story ends
- Conveys the lesson to learn
