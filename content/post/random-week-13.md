## Random number

Wow, I wrote **13** crazy articles about my random life. The first though came in my head is "let search about this crazy number". And this is what I got :

- The sixth prime number, now I got why people hate 13th day in Friday.
- A Happy Number, lol in Math only.
- One of Pythagorean triple. (5, 12, 13).
- This 13th May 2017, 100 years of [Virgin of Fatima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_of_F%C3%A1tima)
- Unlucky number in many cultures. I remembered that Vietnamese appartments didn't label 13th floor but using `12A` for 12th and `12B` for 13th (haha human often lie themself).

> Ah, this article write on May 08 (5 + 8 = 13) !

> Illuminate !!!

## Random place

Last week, I moved my living place to new apartment. (Move away from my family zone). It isn't comfortable, but that's why I decided.

This is the new view, it's young and beautiful city :

## Random movie

Last week, I watched the "Guardians of the Galaxy 2" movie. It's good movie in content, acting and movie effects. Whole movie can be summarized to this quote

> Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life is right there beside you all along.

Btw, I want to complete it to

> Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life is right there inside you all along.

## Random song

The song broke audience's hearts in "Guardians of the Galaxy 2" movie.
