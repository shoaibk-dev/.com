## Random birthday

Last week, I turned to 25. I had a small dinner with my family, that is all I need on that day. Btw, it was just a normal day likes every single day.

The reason of the feeling is every day, when I can take breath, feel the pains, hear the sounds, eat a pie, talk to people and think about random things. It is a special and wonderful day !

Last day, I had a question why people (and I) want to make something special on their birthday and to count number of years they lived in the earth like they're going to die soon. For what ?

## Random trade-off

Yesterday, I saw this sentence on my FB profile : "What is your life's motto ?"

> Everything in life is a trade-off

That is mine ! Of course, everyone is a trader. A good one is WHO know WHAT and WHEN he should trade.

- My brother bought a apartment on bank loan, and he decided to work abroad for 2 years to pay the loan. (So he won't stay in the apartment he wanted in first 2 years) => **You can't use things you wanted, despite you owned it !**
- My friend works hard to make a lot of money, but doesn't care about his health. He said he worked for the passion to conquer higher goal => **People often sell health to buy money, then buy back the health by the more expensive price**

What I learned from them, **I will trade when I know what I really want or things really matter to me.**

## Random song

This song reminded me a story, KING MIDAS
