## Random trip

Last week, I had a trip to Da Nang city with my friends (and my business partners). It's a nice trip, beautiful places, good food and yeah ... cool experience.

In this city, I met a 73-year-old man (wife-father of my friend) who inspired me about works and life.

I asked myself, could I live good as him at that age ? Or still stuck in my small circle ? Or died ?

I am young and idiot but ... arrogant !

> FYI = FUCKING YOUNG & IDIOT !

## Random project

I has been working on a small open source project, I will update it soon in next article.

## Random thoughts

Do I lose my writting passion ? Do I leave something behind ? Do I do that ?

Do I ? Should I ???

Person 1 : "It's a empty glass !"

Person 2 : "Nope, it's full of air !"

...

Person 42 : "It doesn't matter. The only thing matters is people keep thinking about useless thing instead of touching it, using it and ... feeling it."
