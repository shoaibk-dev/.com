# Random comic picture

While reading an article on Medium, I visited this page [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/). It's fanstastic website, where you can get a random comic about sarcasm, math and language everyday. And this is what I got today, [https://xkcd.com/1783/](https://xkcd.com/1783/)

![email backlog](/images/2017/03/emails_backlog.png)

Haha, it's cool idea, like an idea from Choose Yourself book (someday, you should try to reply 10 year-email) . It reminded me that I got some old email accounts when I was young. Then I signed in to a random one, `admin.vmind@gmail.com`. This is email account when I wrote a tiny software named VMind (check it on Google [here](https://goo.gl/ackV7i) ) when I was 14. Then this is what I got from the Inbox

LOL, that's a bug report from a user for a 10-year software without maintenance. It makes my day !

> If you want to have a happy moment 10 years later, just do something makes you happy today. - Unknown author

It's fucking gold ! When I wrote that software, I was happy because I did it for passion, helping people and money careless. And this is my reply to him

# Random article

[GetPocket](https://getpocket.com) is a service where you can save good articles within 1-click extension. And it has an **Explore** page, where you can find good article recommended by people. This is what I got from it, [Stop Spending So Much Time In Your Head](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/stop-spending-so-much-time-in-your-head-1381441550)

The main idea is :

> 99% of your thoughts are useless !

> So stop thinking and start feeling.

Then I start :

- Feeling bitter of Dutch beer, Belgium beer and Americano coffee mixed in 1 night
- Feeling air on deep breathing
- Feeling tired when push-up
- Feeling cold water on morning shower
- Feeling wind when riding at 80 km/h
- Feeling dirty smoke in traffic jam
- Feeling weak light in darkness
- Feeling stucks in work
- Feeling lovely pains
- Feeling nil

# Random bible

Last sunday, the priest told a story from old testament. The story about a man named [JOB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1&version=NIV), and his best say is

> Naked I came from my motherâ€™s womb,

> and naked I will depart.

> The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away;

> may the name of the Lord be praised.

Yeah, **you bring nothing into life, so nothing can be brought out from it when you die**. Only shared ideas, shared happiness and shared pains will be left. (Okayyy maybe shared diamonds too)

This makes me remember the song I liked, [The Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtF6Jej8yb4)

# Random question

> Why people keep following the lost things ?

> Is it curiousness or just self-deception ?

NOPE ! I only lied to opposite man in mirror ! Haha..
