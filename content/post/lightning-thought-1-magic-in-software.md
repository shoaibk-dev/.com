## Random quote

> “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” - Albert Einstein

It's true in LOGIC ! But sometimes, it goes wrong in computer science and ... life.

## What does computer program do ?

We learnt from Computer Science courses this phisolophy :

> PROGRAM takes INPUT and produces OUTPUT

> So, same PROGRAM + same INPUT = same OUTPUT

And that's the basis of every testing techniques. We expect specified OUTPUT for the specified INPUT. If not, it fails !

## What happens in reality ?

> IT's MAGIC !

Sometimes it works, sometime it doesn't ! This is common situation in developer's life and human's life

But, have you ever think the root of it ? Why ? How ? It happened ?

I'm drunk when writing this, but this is my random thoughts :

- **Time** : of course, time affects everything it touched but I seperate to 2 reasons
    - **Randomization** : any random thing depends on timing. At A, it was X. But at B, it will be Y. So the program or life depends on 1 random thing is unstable, unpredictable and magic !
    - **Limitation** : everything has its limitation, once you go over that, you will be blocked or have to wait.
- **Dependencies** : anything has dependencies, even NOTHING depends on EVERY dependencies.
    - **Unavailable** : dead, down-time, overloaded
    - **Break Changes** : you need X but dependency has Y

## How about human life ?

If you keep doing the same thing but different attitude, magic can happen !

That's why machines can't win human !

> Because human is unpredictable !
