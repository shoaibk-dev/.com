What a day !

- Bank account has to be closed
- Forgot to turn off unused service before billing
- Email account get stuck in forwarding, get important emails dismissed
- Email sending system had been suspended because of sending a lot of bounced emails without notice
- Internet oversea cables got damaged, speed is slow, can't do anything planed

Luckily, I'm still alive to feel these pains. Thank GOD, please keep giving to me your pains, everyday !

I realized, in the end of day what we really need isn't money nor love but a sleep. It's basic human equality

```php
while ($me->alive()) {
    $me->doCrazyThing();
    $me->enjoyMoment();
    $pains = $me->feelPains();

    sleep(60 * 60 * ($pains > 3 ? 8 : 6));
}
```
