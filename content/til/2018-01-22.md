# DEVOPS

## Ansible running host pattern

Ansible supports pattern to select and filter running hosts from all hosts. Here is some common pattern

- `*` : wildcard, standalone mean `all`
- `group1,group2` : run hosts belong to group1 or group2
- `*.web` : run hosts belongs to group matches pattern. Ex: `backend.web`, `frontend.web`
- `all:!abc` : run all hosts exclude hosts belongs to group `abc`

> Infrastructure by code ;)

# SYSADMIN

## Use journalctl to check system logs

Logging and Monitoring are important factor for system admin. Checking the log will help you have a closer look into the issue. One tool could help you will handy features is `journalctl`.

Here are simple options :

- `-f` : follow the log (tailf)
- `-u [service]` : filter to show only [service] logs
- `--since=[date]` : Show entries not older than the specified date
- `--until=[date]` : Show entries not newer than the specified date 

Example :

```bash
$ sudo journalctl -u nginx.service
$ sudo journalctl -u nginx.service --since yesterday
$ sudo journalctl -u nginx.service --since "2018-01-01" --until today
```
