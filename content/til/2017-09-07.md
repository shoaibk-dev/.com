# NETWORKING

## TCP FIN timeout

The TCP FIN timeout belays the amount of time a port must be inactive before it can reused for another connection. The default is often 60 seconds, but can normally be safely reduced to 30 or even 15 seconds:

```
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15
```

# SYSADMIN

## Generate dhparam file faster

**openssl** uses strong prime (which is useless for security but requires an awful lot more computational effort. A "strong prime" is a prime p such that (p-1)/2 is also prime). So it will be faster if we add option `-dsaparam` to the command

```bash
$ openssl dhparam -dsaparam -out /etc/ssl/private/dhparam.pem 4096
```

# SYSADMIN

## Lock and unlock a user password

In Linux, you can prevent a user from login by locking it.

**Lock**

```bash
$ sudo passwd -l [user]
```

**Unlock**

```bash
$ sudo passwd -u [user]
```
