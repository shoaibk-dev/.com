## ab failed responses

When benchmarking a HTTP application server using `ab` tool, you shouldn't only care about how many requests per second, but percentage of Success responses.

A notice that you must have the same content-length in responses, because `ab` tool will assume response having different content-length from `Document Length` (in ab result) is failed response.

**Example**

Webserver using Flask

```python
from flask import Flask
from random import randint
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello" * randint(1,3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Benchmark using ab

```bash
$ ab -n 1000 -c 5 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

WARNING: The median and mean for the processing time are not within a normal deviation
        These results are probably not that reliable.

Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%      3
  66%      3
  75%      3
  80%      3

  98%      5
  99%      6
 100%     11 (longest request)
```

**In this example, first response content-length is 10 ("hello" x 2), so every responses has content length is 5 or 15, will be assumed a failed response.**
