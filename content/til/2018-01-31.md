# REDIS

## Transaction style in Redis

In Redis, you can use transaction-style (mean queue commands then flush it once). It will improve performance in many case where latency or networking is slow.

```
> SET hoge 2
OK
> MULTI
OK
> INCR foo
QUEUED
> INCR hoge
QUEUED
> EXEC
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 1
```

`MULTI` command is **begin transaction** and `EXEC` command is **commit transaction**

The result will be returned in order your command queue list.

# VARNISH

## Check vcl file syntax before restarting

Like NginX, Varnish has a syntax checker function that helps us test the syntactic correctness.

```bash
$ varnishd -C -f [vcl file path]
```

Varnish will compile the file and output the result to stdout. If something goes wrong, it will throw a message like

```
> Message from VCC-compiler:
> Expected an action, 'if', '{' or '}'
> ('input' Line 74 Pos 6)
>     vcl_hash(req.http.Cookie);
> -----########------------------
>
> Running VCC-compiler failed, exit 1
```
