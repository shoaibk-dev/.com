# SYSADMIN

## BASH exiting on first error

Setting a flag `set -e` to bash script will let the script exit on first error occurs, so if you want to ignore a command just adding ` || true` to suffix

```bash
set -e

errorCmd $1 || true
echo "Run here !"
```

And opposite of `set -e` is `set +e`, haha of course !

```bash
set +e

errorCmd $1
echo "Still run here !"
```

# SYSADMIN

## BASH return a value in function

Creating function is a good way to refactor your bash script. But BASH doesn't support returning a value in true way, so it makes a bit of challenge to handle that.

You can use this trick

```bash
hello() {
	echo "Hello $1"
}

hw=$(hello "KhanhIceTea")
echo $hw
```

But what if you want to echo log message in hello function, it will be merged to returned value.

```bash
hello() {
	echo "System is weaking up and brush its teeth :))"
	echo "Hello $1"
}

hw=$(hello "KhanhIceTea")
echo "This is returned value of hello function :"
echo $hw
```

This is a how to resolve it, forwarding log message to stderr instead of stdout by default

```bash
hello() {
	echo "System is weaking up and brush its teeth :))" >&2
	echo "Hello $1"
}

hw=$(hello "KhanhIceTea")
echo "This is returned value of hello function :"
echo $hw
```
