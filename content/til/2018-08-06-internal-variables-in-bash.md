## Internal Variables in BASH

### $PWD

Your current working directory, so you don't have to use `CWD=$(pwd)`

### $OLDPWD

Your previous working directory

**Note** : You can jump directly to it by the command `cd -`

### $SECONDS

The number of seconds the script has been running

You can use it for profiling or limiting timeout

```bash
TIME_LIMIT=60
START=$SECONDS
while [ $(($SECONDS - START)) -le "$TIME_LIMIT" ]
do
	## Your work here
done

echo "It takes $SECONDS seconds to get here !"
```

### $RANDOM

Get random integer number, for getting random name or just roll a dice ;)
