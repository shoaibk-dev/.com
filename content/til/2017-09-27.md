# LINUX

## Send ENTER key to kernel

When you try to send an Enter keyboard to linux kernel, it looks like nothing happens.

This is because you only send a key press (KEY DOWN) but don't send an key release (KEY UP) event after that.

# SYSADMIN

## BASH tracing commands

Thanks Hiro Ishii teach me this

`set -x` will print all running commands in your bash script

So I dove in and look for all set options of BASH.

And this is what I got , http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html
