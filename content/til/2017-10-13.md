# DATABASE

## Indexes on multiple columns

Let's say you have an indexes on 2 columns (A, B) of the table (X). So this is three use cases happen :

1. You query data based on both of 2 columns => Indexes will be considered
2. You query data based on (A) => Indexes will be considered
3. You query data based on (B) => Indexes will be ignored because database indexes your data by B-tree algo. So it can't search node via a B => If you want, just create another indexes on B column

I said `will be considered` because it depends on your query and your data (query optimizer will decide it !)

# DEVOPS

## Using netcat to wait a TCP service

When doing a CI/CD testing, you would need to connect a external service (RDBMS, HTTP server or generic TCP server service). So you need waiting the service before running your test app.

One way to do right waiting instead of sleep for a specified time is using `netcat` tool

```bash
$ while ! echo -e '\x04' | nc [service_host] [service_port]; do sleep 1; done;
```

Examples

- MySQL service on port 3306

```bash
$ while ! echo -e '\x04' | nc 127.0.0.1 3306; do sleep 1; done;
$ ./run_test.sh
```

Explanation :

`echo -e '\x04'` will send an EOT (End Of Transmission) to the TCP every second to check if it's ready !
