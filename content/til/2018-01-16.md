# LINUX

## Disable IPv6 to stop getting stuck in network

I know IPv6 will be future for networking, but at this moment "It's suck !" :(

Some service will be failed when trying to connect IPv6 destination :

- apt package manager
- smtp
- curl

So I decided to disable IPv6 on every production server.

```bash
$ echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
$ echo "net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
$ echo "net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
$ 
$ sudo sysctl -p
```

I will re-enable it when everything works perfectly !

# NETWORKING

## Set up simple rate limiting on specified port using UFW

Allow unmetrered connections on networking is so risky. Attacker can use the brute-force attacks to comprosise your service (or simple DOS).

Linux has a cool firewall to hanlde this, via `ip-tables`. But it's so complicated to remember all the rule and syntax. That's why `UFW` was born to save us. :D

You can use simple command to manage your firewall

```bash
$ ufw default deny incoming # deny any incoming port, should be run before allow any port
$ ufw default allow outgoing # allow any outgoing port
$ ufw allow 80 # allow port 80
$ ufw deny 53/udp # allow udp protocol to port 53
$ ufw disable # disable firewall
$ ufw enable # enable firewall
$ ufw status # check all the rules
$ ufw delete [num] # delete the rule by its order in status result
$ ufw reload # reload all rule
$ ufw limit ssh/tcp # finnaly, limit ssh (port 22 tcp), deny connections if an IP address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last 30 seconds
```
