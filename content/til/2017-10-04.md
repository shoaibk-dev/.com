# NETWORKING

## How SMTP works

When a email send through an SMTP (with authentication), every SMTP server is a hop in mail routing. So it will transfer to localmail or forward the email to next hop (shortest distance via DNS MX record).

And standard port of SMTP is 25 (unsecured, but can upgrade to TLS via STARTTLS command).

```bash
$ nslookup -type=mx gmail.com 8.8.8.8
Server:         8.8.8.8       
Address:        8.8.8.8#53    

Non-authoritative answer:     
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 20 alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.                                                    
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.                                                          
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 30 alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.                                                    
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 10 alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.                                                    
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 40 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.

So shortest SMTP of gmail.com domain is `gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com`

```bash
$ telnet gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com 25
```

# SYSADMIN

## TIME command output meaning

When you want to know how long does it take to run a process, just use `time` command as a prefix

```bash
$ time my_program arg1 arg2
real        0m0.003s
user        0m0.000s
sys         0m0.004s
```

- **real** : wall clock time, mean time to start to finish your process
- **user** : CPUs-time outside the kernel
- **sys** : CPUs-time within the kernel

**real+sys** result is total multi CPUs time (so if you have a multi core CPUs, it is often bigger than **real**)
