# TOOLS

## Zip compressing list of files

To specify a list of compressed files when using **zip** cli tool, you could use `-@ [file_list]` flag. And `file_list` is a file contains list of compressed file (new line separated)

Example

```bash
$ zip changed.zip -@ changed_files.txt
```

Or use stdin pipe

```bash
$ find . -mmin -60 -print | zip changed_1_hour_ago -@
```

This will zip all changed files 1 hour ago

# SYSADMIN

## Blocking specified country to prevent from DDOS

Last day I checked system logs and got a lot of warning messages mentioned that my server has been attack via Brute-force. So I decided to blocked some countries from connecting to attacked ports (21, 25). They are China, Russia and US.

This site provides a list of IP blocks of specified country
