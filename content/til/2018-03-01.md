# WEB

## Sending Cookie in AJAX CORs request

By default, browser will remove the cookie and authorization header from AJAX CORs request. So
before sending out the request, make sure `withCredentials` must be true.

In this case, CORs response must specify which origin is allowed (mean
no wildcard allowed origin rule).

# SYSADMIN

## Prevent source hacking from .git directory exposing

Many web project use Git as source version control tools. So in production
server, we could expose the hidden `.git` directory - which contains all most
infomation about project source code.

To "rip" a source code from a vulnerable website, we can use this tool : https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper#git

So to prevent this happens, try to deny all http access to hidden files and
directories (usually starts by `.` character)

Example of Nginx config

```
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
}
```
